const EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `You are reading an itemized medical bill. Return every billed line item as JSON.
Rules:
- Copy codes exactly as printed. Never guess or correct a code.
- "sourceText" must be the exact text of that line as printed on the bill, including the code.
- Dates as YYYY-MM-DD. Money as plain numbers without $ or commas.
- Include revenueCode, placeOfService, typeOfBill, admission/discharge dates, statedTotal (total charges), and amountDue (the balance the patient is asked to pay) only if printed on the bill.
- Do not include payments, adjustments, or insurance lines as line items.`;

const EOB_PROMPT = `You are reading a health insurance Explanation of Benefits (EOB). Return every service line as JSON.
Rules:
- Copy codes exactly as printed, and leave "code" out if the statement doesn't show one. Never guess a code.
- "billed" is the amount the provider charged the insurer. "patientResponsibility" is everything the patient owes for that line (deductible, copay, coinsurance, and amounts not covered).
- "sourceText" must be the exact text of that line as printed.
- Dates as YYYY-MM-DD. Money as plain numbers without $ or commas.
- Do not include summary or total rows as lines.`;

const LETTER_PROMPT = `Write one short, factual paragraph for each finding below, for a patient's billing dispute letter to the provider's billing office.
Rules:
- Write in the first person, as the patient ("my bill", "my insurer"). The findings are written to the patient ("you"); rephrase them.
- Use only the facts in the finding. Do not add charges, amounts, or claims that are not there.
- Each paragraph must contain every item in that finding's "mustInclude": codes, dollar amounts, and dates exactly as written, and unit counts as digits (for example, "3 units"). A paragraph without the specific codes and amounts gives the billing office nothing to act on.
- Name the service in parentheses after its code, using "services" (for example, "Code 93000 (electrocardiogram)").
- Write any dollar amount exactly as it appears in the finding's amount or evidence, formatted like $1,234.56.
- Write dates like September 14, 2026. Say "the Medicare rate" and "Medicare's limit", not "benchmark" or "CMS". Leave out the flagging threshold and the phrase "disputed amount".
- Vary how paragraphs open; don't start each one with the date.
- Never mention finding IDs, line IDs, or statement IDs. You may cite the insurer's name and claim number.
- For "billing_error" findings, ask for the charge to be removed or corrected, naming the amount to remove.
- For "pricing_concern" findings, give the charge and the Medicare rate, rounding the multiple ("about 9 times"), and ask the provider to explain how the charge was set or reduce it. Do not call it an error and do not state a difference to remove.
- For "insurance_missing", ask the provider to confirm the charge was submitted to the insurer, and to submit it if not, before billing the patient.
- For "insurance_charge", ask the provider to correct the bill to match what the insurer was billed, or explain the difference.
- For "insurance_balance", ask for a corrected balance, and note that the other corrections in the letter may resolve part of the difference.
- Return exactly one section per finding ID.

Examples of the style wanted:
- "Code 85025 (CBC with automated differential) is billed twice on September 14, 2026, with identical units and modifiers. Please remove the repeated $64.00 charge."
- "Code 80053 (comprehensive metabolic panel) is billed at $186.00, about 18 times the Medicare rate of $10.56. Please explain how this charge was set, or reduce it."`;
